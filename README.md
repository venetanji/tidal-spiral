# Tidal Spiral Generative Art

This project visualizes tidal data as a moving spiral using Python and pygame. Tidal data (from a CSV or similar) is used to influence the spiral's properties such as radius, color, and speed.

## Features
- Load tidal data from a CSV file
- Animate a spiral whose properties are influenced by the data
- Real-time visualization using pygame

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pygame
- numpy

## Usage
1. Place your tidal data CSV in the project directory (see `tidal_data.csv` as an example).
2. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Customization
- Modify `main.py` to change how the spiral responds to tidal data.
- Replace `tidal_data.csv` with your own data as needed.
